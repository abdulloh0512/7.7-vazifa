## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Message` fields are empty should show "This field can't be empty"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"

## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [React-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - For form validation


### What I learned

This is the third time i create a website using a next JS but this is really the first time i create it by my self without following the tutorial. I really think this challenge is perfect to see if i can implement what i already know from the tutorial. This is including using image, routing with multiple API and using re-usable component (since i see there is some section that is used in multiple page).

The hurdle and the problem that i get is when dealing with the given svg. Since i only get 1 svg but the design need me to change the color of the svg. Fortunately there is a package called svgr/webpack that makes it easier to change the color of the svg. i also learnt how to do it in some youtube video for implement custom svg in next js in the link down below:

This challenge is really make me realise that it is always better to plan ahead what will you do before get down and start coding. It always good to set up the design system provided in the figma file in the tailwind config file since it will help you save time in the long run. it also good to think first about the layout of your website in your mind first and how you implement it using css rule before it get messy and lose track of what you do.

### Continued development

From this onward, i think i wanna go challenge my self with next JS api which i heard it make your life easier to interact your front end with database. Starting with the challenge from e-commece page. Look forward to do exciting challenge in the front-end area that also learn a little bit about the back-end.
